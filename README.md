# LaTeX Introduction

Welcome to the LaTeX introduction workshop.
This is the first in a series of workshops aimed at getting people comfortable with the typesetting tool LaTeX, and ensuring that they're able to create great documents effectively and efficiently.
To grab blank versions of the LaTeX code (with the preamble and example definitions, but without the text) you can go [here](https://github.com/humdrumcomet/LaTeXCodingSession).
